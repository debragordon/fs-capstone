# Back End Capstone: DuckDuck

DuckDuck is a clean and modern Early Education Center administration and management software application that tracks enrollment, room occupancy and waitlist. DuckDuck is a mobile app which can work on all tablets and smartphones for convenient, on-the-go use.

### Goal

Create an online tool for the administrator of a daycare to manage their student enrollment where they can add a student, edit their details and manage their enrollment.  All students are in a specific, age/ability appropriate room and this app will ensure that they are getting the right care at all times.  The added feature will be the waiting list tied to each room.  The app will alert the site manager when spots appear and grab from the waiting list who should be considered for the spot.
